# Tiny Terminal CSS

**Tiny Terminal CSS** is a lightweight, retro-inspired CSS framework designed to bring the aesthetic of classic terminals and "movie hacker" vibes to your web projects. 

It focuses on styling semantic HTML elements directly, avoiding the use of custom classes to ensure simplicity and maintain semantic integrity.

Inspired by [Just fucking use HTML](https://justfuckingusehtml.com/) and [Tiny Brutalism CSS](https://github.com/pruger/tiny-brutalism-css).

**No frameworks. No dependencies. Just pure CSS.**

Size: ~8KB (Small enough to fit on a floppy disk!)
